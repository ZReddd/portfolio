            <h3>AR Pattern Recognition for Education</h3>
            <p>
                This application was developed during my undergraduate studies as an AR educational tool for a primary school in Taiwan. The software utilizes image recognition to identify content from textbooks and project interactive 3D models of human organs.
                <br><br>
                This engaging approach allows young students to explore and learn about various organs in a fun and intuitive way. Each organ model includes an individual description that appears when selected, providing detailed information without the need for physical models.
                <br><br>
                This has significantly reduced the school's costs for anatomical models.
            </p>

            <p>
                Additionally, students can interact with each organ model by opening, closing, and rotating the 3D representations. This hands-on experience enhances their understanding by allowing them to observe organs from multiple angles. Watch the videos below to see how students can control the visibility and orientation of each organ model.
